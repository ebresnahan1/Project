        <p> Womenâ€™s lacrosse, sometimes shortened to lax, is a sport played with twelve players on each team. Originally played by indigenous peoples of the Americas, the modern women's game was introduced in 1890 at the St Leonard's School in St Andrews, Scotland. The rules of women's lacrosse differ significantly from men's field lacrosse.</p>

        <br/>

        <p>The object of the game is to use a long-handled stick to catch, cradle, and pass a solid yellow rubber lacrosse ball in an effort to score by hurling the ball into an opponent's goal. The head of the lacrosse stick has a mesh or leather net strung into it that allows the player to hold the ball. Defensively the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body positioning. The rules of women's lacrosse are different from the men's lacrosse game. Equipment required to play is also different from the men's. In the United States, women are only required to wear eyewear or lacrosse goggles and a mouth guard. Internationally, women are only required to wear a mouthguard, and have the option to play without protective goggles. The stick has restrictions too, as it must be a certain length and the pocket must be shallow enough to show the ball when held at eye level.</p>

        <br/>

        <p>At the collegiate level in the United States, lacrosse is represented by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which conducts an NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship each spring. Internationally, women's lacrosse has a thirty-one-member governing body called the Federation of International Lacrosse, which sponsors the Women's Lacrosse World Cup once every four years.</p>
